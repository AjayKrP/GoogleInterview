1. Insert operation in a balanced binary tree
2. https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/ - Apply DFS
3. Tail recursion for Fibonacci â€“ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/
4. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-the-intersection-point-of-two-linked-lists/ - traverse both linked list
5. Sorted Array, count frequency of all numbers in less than O(n) - left & right boundary
6. Longest Palindromic Substring - expand over middle
   https://youtu.be/XYQecbcd6_c
7. Graphs - Return the area of the biggest island. (Modification of - find the number of islands) - Count total number of 1s
8. Stack - Calculate the sum of minimums of all possible sub-arrays. - apply backtracking
9. Find next greater element in an array (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/next-greater-element/) - apply monolithic stack
10. Check if Binary Tree is a balanced BST - check height of every node in BST if its less than or equal to 1 then its Balanced BST
