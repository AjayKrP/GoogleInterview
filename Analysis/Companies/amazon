16. You are a in-flight movie service provider. You are given a list of movie lengths and the duration of
the flight. Return a pair of (2) movies whose combined length is the highest and is less than or equal to
flight duration. If multiple such combinations are possible, return the pair which has the movie of longer
 longest duration.
Ex :
MovieLenghts : {27, 1,10, 39, 12, 52, 32, 67, 76}
Flight Duration : 77.
The 2 possible pairs are (1,76) and (10,67), The answer is (1,76) as per the last constraint.

  the association group with the highest number of elements. If two groups have the same size,
   return the group that has the lexological smallest element between these 2. Also while returning
   the group, return it in a lexological sorted order.
Sample Input : {{Item0,Item1}, {Item2, Item3}, {Item0, Item4}}
